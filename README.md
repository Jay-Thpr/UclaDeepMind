# Bear With Me

Your AI coach for real-world skills.

![Bear With Me hero](screenshots/hero-banner.png)

Bear With Me is a multimodal coaching app that helps learners practice real skills with live feedback, visual corrections, and persistent progression. Instead of acting like a generic chat assistant, it researches a skill, launches a live coaching session, and generates annotated feedback directly on the learner's own practice footage.

---

## What It Does

- **Research-first coaching**: Generate a Gemini research dossier for any skill before you start practicing
- **Live multimodal session**: Connect camera and microphone for real-time spoken coaching with Gemini Live
- **Visual form correction**: Capture annotated stills from your own practice footage showing proper technique
- **Google Cloud integration**: Auto-upload annotated images to Google Photos, export session summaries to Google Docs
- **Persistent progression**: Track skills, levels, streaks, practice time, and session history across your Google account

## The Problem

![The Problem](screenshots/problem-slide.png)

Learning real-world skills—cooking, movement, music, physical techniques—still has three major gaps:

- **YouTube tutorials** are broad, one-way, and not personalized to what you're doing wrong right now
- **Human coaches** are powerful but expensive, scarce, and not always available on demand
- **Current AI tutors** are usually chat-first products with weak connection to embodied practice

For physical skills, the hard part isn't access to information. The hard part is getting **timely, specific feedback while practicing**.

## Our Solution

![Our Solution](screenshots/solution-slide.png)

Bear With Me is a generalized coaching engine for skill-building.

The system first creates a structured knowledge base for the selected skill, then uses that context during a live Gemini session to coach the learner in real time. When words aren't enough, it captures a still from the learner's own video and generates visual corrections directly on top of the frame.

**The learning loop:**

1. Research the skill → structured dossier generation
2. Coach the learner live → multimodal Gemini Live session
3. Generate visual corrections → annotated stills from your practice footage
4. Save progress → session summaries, stats, and Google integration
5. Carry context forward → next session uses previous progression and coach notes

## What Makes This Special

### 1. Research-First Coaching

The app generates a structured skill dossier **before** coaching starts, giving the AI deep domain context instead of relying on a generic prompt.

**Research covers:**
- Skill overview and core concepts
- Skill decomposition into learnable components
- Progression milestones and practice design
- Common mistakes and safety notes

### 2. Live Multimodal Feedback

Gemini Live responds to **camera and microphone** in real-time with concise spoken guidance. The coach sees what you're doing and hears what you're asking.

### 3. Visual Corrections on Your Footage

When verbal feedback isn't enough, the app captures **your actual practice frame** and generates an annotated correction showing the proper form, grip, or posture.

### 4. Persistent Google Integration

**OAuth-secured sessions** with encrypted credential storage:

- **Annotated stills auto-upload** to your Google Photos in a skill-specific album
- **Session summaries export** to your Google Docs with duration, progress delta, and coach notes
- **All scoped to your Google account** - your data, your cloud storage

### 5. Progression Memory

The backend persists:
- Skills and research dossiers
- Progress events (level-ups, photos, milestones)
- Session summaries with coach notes
- Stats: level, streak, total practice time, mastery percentage

This allows the AI to **remember your journey** and personalize future sessions.

## Demo Flow

### 0. Pick a focus area

The experience starts with a playful skill picker that makes the product feel like a guided journey.

![Skill picker](screenshots/skill-select-arena.png)

### 1. Create your skill

Enter a skill, concrete goal, and starting level. The backend generates a Gemini research dossier and persists the new skill.

![Create your skill](screenshots/onboarding-flow.png)

### 2. Review your journey

The dashboard shows your selected skill, current level, accumulated practice, streak, and progress toward the next level.

![Journey dashboard](screenshots/dashboard-journey.png)

### 3. Start a live coaching session

Start camera and microphone, connect to Gemini Live, and receive spoken realtime guidance. When verbal feedback is insufficient, the app captures a still and generates a marked-up correction image.

## Architecture

The demo is built around a single end-to-end technical loop: generate skill context, inject it into a live Gemini session, capture visual corrections when needed, and persist the outcome for the next session.

    T --> U[(Updated stats + progress event + session summary)]
    U --> V[Export session summary to Google Docs]
```

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Browser never sees long-lived Gemini API key** - backend mints ephemeral Live tokens per session
- **Skill-specific system instructions** - Live context assembled from stored research, stats, and recent summaries
- **OAuth tokens encrypted at rest** - Fernet (cryptography.io) with base64-encoded 32-byte keys
- **Form correction rate-limited** - 30-second cooldown prevents annotation spam
- **Google Photos album per skill** - annotated stills organized by skill title
- **Session-scoped auth cookies** - HTTP-only, SameSite=Lax, secure in production

## Product Architecture

### Research Layer

Skill creation triggers a Gemini-generated markdown dossier covering:

- Skill overview and core concepts
- Skill decomposition into learnable components
- Progression milestones and practice design
- Common mistakes and safety notes (when relevant)

This research row becomes part of the live coaching context.

### Live Coaching Layer

The session experience combines:

- Browser camera + mic capture
- Gemini Live realtime WebSocket connection
- Dynamic system-instruction assembly from persisted skill memory
- Short spoken coaching responses optimized for practice flow

### Visual Correction Layer

Annotated stills are generated from the learner's own camera frame. The image model is prompted to **show the corrected posture** or tool position, not just overlay arrows on top of a mistake.

Rate-limited to 30-second cooldown to prevent spam.

### Persistence Layer

The backend stores:

- **Skills** - title, goal, starting level, user ownership
- **Research entries** - Gemini-generated skill dossiers
- **Progress events** - level-ups, photos, milestones, practice sessions
- **Session summaries** - duration, coach notes, progress delta, Gemini-estimated learning outcomes

This allows the app to keep a **memory of practice over time** and personalize future sessions.

### Google Integration Layer

**Photos:** Annotated stills are uploaded to a skill-specific album in the user's Google Photos. The album is created if it doesn't exist. Returns `album_id`, `media_item_id`, and `product_url`.

**Docs:** Session summaries are appended to a Google Doc titled `"Skill Quest — {email} — {skill_title} Session Summaries"`. The document is created if it doesn't exist. Exports include session number, duration, coach notes, progress delta, and summary text.

**Drive:** (Scoped for future expansion) User-authorized file storage for practice videos, skill resources, and coach-curated materials.

**Calendar:** (Scoped for future expansion) Scheduled practice reminders and session booking.

---

## Deployment Notes

### Backend

- Set `DATABASE_URL` to Postgres connection string for production
- Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` when behind HTTPS
- Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your deployed frontend origin
- Never expose `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `JWT_SECRET` in client-side code

### Frontend

Set `VITE_API_URL` before `npm run build`:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com npm run build
```

Then deploy the `frontend/dist` folder to your static host.

### Database

SQLite is fine for demos and local development. For production with multiple users:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Migrations are handled automatically via SQLModel on startup.
