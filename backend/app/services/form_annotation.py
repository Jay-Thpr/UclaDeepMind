MARKUP_STYLE = """How to edit the image (priority order):
1) Show what the learner SHOULD do — prefer editing the photo so the body, hands, tool, or posture visibly reflect the correct or target form (adjusted angle, alignment, grip, stance). Use gentle pose correction, a ghosted "target" outline, a faint second silhouette, or a small before/after inset if that makes the fix obvious. The goal is a picture of the right movement, not only symbols on top of a wrong pose.
2) Add arrows, arcs, circles, and short labels only when they help emphasis or direction; do not rely on arrows alone if a literal corrected pose or tool position would be clearer.
3) Keep the same scene and subject recognizable. Use high-contrast markup colors when you add overlays (yellow/white; green for "toward correct", red/orange sparingly for "adjust this")."""

Rules:
- Treat the block between the --- lines as authoritative. Do not add different problems or contradict the coach.
- Illustrate the corrections by showing the intended form or motion when possible (adjusted limbs, tool angle, spine line, etc.), not only with arrows on the current pose.
- Arrows, circles, and labels must match the coach's intent and may supplement the edit for direction or emphasis.
- If the frame does not show something the coach mentioned, state that briefly in your text note and depict only what is visible.

- Add arrows, circles, and short labels when they clarify direction or emphasis.
